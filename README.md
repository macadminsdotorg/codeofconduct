#Welcome to the MacAdmins Slack Team.

## Introduction
This community is a complement to the Freenode IRC channels, the various MDM and package management user forums, the Facebook groups, and the mailing lists and seeks to provide a safe, friendly community for Mac administrators, enthusiasts, and developers to interact with one another.

We hope that you find the community to be enriching to your personal and professional lives, and above all else a place of camaraderie where our collective knowledge and differences are celebrated in a positive, welcoming environment.

Thank you for following this code of conduct. We reserve the right to amend or change the code of conduct at any time and encourage you to periodically review these guidelines to ensure a safe environment for all.

##Code Of Conduct

All are welcome to participate within the Slack instance as long as the tenets of this Code of Conduct are adhered to.

## Summary


Abide by Wheaton’s Law: don’t be a dick.

Everyone is welcome to participate, and no judgement will be made on members of the greater Mac community who are not a part of the community.

## The Details:


### Policies

The MacAdmins Slack Team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of (but not limited to): gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or preferred technological ecosystem. 


We do not tolerate harassment of Slack participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue. Slack participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the MacAdmins Slack at the discretion of the Administrative Team. 

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Offensive and/or unwelcome comments and behaviors related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or preferred technological ecosystem.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following 
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop
* Unwelcome sexual attention including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour
* Hate speech
* Repeatedly asking questions of an individual or targeted group, even if remaining calm/civil while doing so (aka ["Sea-lioning"] (http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2014/11/word-of-the-week-sea-lioning.html))
* Asking questions in bad faith, or framed in such a way to come across as hostile
* Manipulating, or the attempt to manipulate (someone) by psychological means into questioning their own sanity. Purposefully presenting false information to another making them doubt their own memory, perception or sanity (aka [gas-lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting))
* Spamming of GIFs
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour	


### Enforcement
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the Administrative Team retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the MacAdmins Slack.

The Administrative Team may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the community or making the environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules in all public and private channels (including direct messages).

### Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, and you feel comfortable speaking with the offender, please inform the offender that they have affected you negatively. Oftentimes, the offending behavior is unintentional, and the accidental offender and offended will resolve the incident by having that initial discussion. As a world-wide community, we recognize that there are inherent language barriers we must work together to overcome.

The MacAdmins Slack Team recognizes that there are many reasons speaking directly to the offender may not be workable for you (including but not limited to unfamiliarity with the Slack environment or its participants, [lack of spoons] (http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/), and concerns for personal safety). If you don't feel comfortable speaking directly with the offender *for any reason*, please report violations directly to a member of the Administrative Team.

[Current List of Administrators](https://github.com/macadminsdotorg/slack-assets/blob/master/Admins).

All reports will be handled with discretion. 

If a party to a dispute is also a member of the Admin team, that person will have no role in the dispute resolution process except as a party; forfeiting any involvement in the enforcement and resolution process. It is the responsibility of that person to immediately inform the Admin team of the conflict. The only way a conflict of interest is applicable is when a person involved in the mediation/resolution process is also involved in the conflict. As members, we are entrusted to make decisions in the best interest of the community and set aside personal interest for the best interest of our community as a whole.

If you have concerns regarding this Slack instance please feel free to contact the Administrative Team and we will work to understand and address them respectfully and with an appropriate level of privacy to the given situation.
