## Reporting

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **Contact an Admin directly** via direct message
   - Current Admins are announced monthly in #announce
   - Any Admin can help, or will connect you with the right person

2. **Use the @admins mention** in the channel (for urgent matters)
   - This notifies all Admins immediately
   - Use this for urgent safety concerns or ongoing harassment

3. **Email:** admin@macadmins.org (if you prefer not to use Slack)

### What to Include

When reporting, please provide:
- Your contact information
- Description of the incident
- Date, time, and location (channel or DM)
- Usernames of those involved
- Links to messages (if applicable)
- Whether the situation is ongoing
- Any other relevant context

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 24 hours (sooner for urgent matters)
- **Confidentiality:** Reports are handled privately by the Admin team
- **No retaliation:** Reporting in good faith will not result in negative consequences
- **Updates:** You'll be informed of the outcome when appropriate

## Enforcement

### Progressive Discipline

For repeated violations:
1. First offense: Level-appropriate response
