## [1. Purpose](#1-purpose)

The Mac Admins Slack is a global community for professionals managing Apple devices. For more than ten years, it has provided a common space for people throughout the globe to connect with each other, solve problems, and learn new technologies. This place has provided common ground for Mac Admins, vendors, Apple, and other interested parties to work on problems, devise solutions, talk through challenges, and build new workflows.

The coordination of this place has long depended on the community's openness to each other, professional respect for each other, and dedication to the larger mission.

This Code of Conduct ensures our workspace remains welcoming, professional, and productive for all members.

## [2. Scope](#2-scope)

The scope of this agreement is very broad, because this community is very broad. This Code of Conduct document is intended to be clear for all the people reading and all who are part of this community.

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All public channels
- All private channels
- Direct messages between members
- Any workspace communication or interaction

## [3. Our Commitment](#3-our-commitment)

The Mac Admins Foundation has a clear obligation to keep the Mac Admins Slack a safe and open community. This is designed to welcome new members, encourage collaboration in our global community, and provide psychological safety for our members.

We are committed to providing a harassment-free, professional environment for everyone, regardless of:

- Gender identity and expression

## [5. Unacceptable Behavior](#5-unacceptable-behavior)

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
- Offensive comments related to protected characteristics

This includes but is not limited to: scraping tools, export utilities, archiving scripts, or bulk download tools for purposes such as AI training, data analysis, or external storage
- Any conduct that creates a hostile, intimidating, or exclusionary environment for community members (including sustained patterns of behavior that may individually seem minor but collectively undermine community safety)

Admin decisions can be appealed to MAF leadership through the [appeals process](#8-appeals).

## [11. Privacy and Data Retention](#11-privacy-and-data-retention)

**Important:** Members should be aware of the following data practices:

- The Mac Admins Slack operates on a Business+ plan with full message and file retention
- All messages, files, and content are retained permanently in Slack's systems
- Users may request deletion of individual messages, but bulk data deletion or "right to be forgotten" is not available
- Admins can access all channels and DMs if needed for Code of Conduct investigations
- Admin access is logged, auditable, and subject to strict confidentiality policies
- Do not post sensitive information (passwords, credentials, personal data, etc.)
- Assume any content posted may become public

**Data Exfiltration**

Using automated tools to download or export workspace content violates our community's privacy expectations and is strictly prohibited. This includes:

- Using third-party export or archiving tools
- Bulk downloading messages or files
- Scraping member data for any purpose
- Training AI models on workspace content

Members who need specific content preserved should use Slack's built-in bookmark and save features. Organizations with legitimate archival needs should contact the MAF Board.
