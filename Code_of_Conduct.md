## 1. Purpose

The Mac Admins Slack is a global community for professionals managing Apple devices. For more than ten years, it has provided a common space for people throughout the globe to connect with each other, solve problems, and learn new technologies. This place has provided common ground for Mac Admins, vendors, Apple, and other interested parties to work on problems, devise solutions, talk through challenges, and build new workflows.

The coordination of this place has long depended on the community's openness to each other, professional respect for each other, and dedication to the larger mission.

This Code of Conduct ensures our workspace remains welcoming, professional, and productive for all members.
