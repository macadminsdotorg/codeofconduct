# The Mac Admins Slack Code of Conduct

**Version:** 4.0 (Proposed)
**Last Updated:** 3 October 2025
**Owner:** Mac Admins Foundation
**Review Cycle:** Annually

## Purpose

The Mac Admins Slack is a global community for professionals managing Apple devices. For more than ten years, it has provided a common space for people throughout the globe to connect with each other, solve problems, and learn new technologies. This place has provided common ground for Mac Admins, vendors, Apple, and other interested parties to work on problems, devise solutions, talk through challenges, and build new workflows.

The coordination of this place has long depended on the community's openness to each other, professional respect for each other, and dedication to the larger mission.

This Code of Conduct ensures our workspace remains welcoming, professional, and productive for all members.

## Scope

The scope of this agreement is very broad, because this community is very broad. This Code of Conduct document is intended to be clear for all the people reading and all who are part of this community.

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- All public channels
- All private channels
- Direct messages between members
- Any workspace communication or interaction

## Our Commitment

The Mac Admins Foundation has a clear obligation to keep the Mac Admins Slack a safe and open community. This is designed to welcome new members, encourage collaboration in our global community, and provide psychological safety for our members.

We are committed to providing a harassment-free, professional environment for everyone, regardless of:
- Gender identity and expression
- Sexual orientation
- Age
- Disability (visible or invisible)
- Physical appearance
- Race and ethnicity
- Nationality
- Language skills and proficiency
- Religion or lack thereof
- Political affiliation
- Professional experience level
- Educational background

## Expected Behavior

All community members are expected to:
- Be respectful and professional in all interactions
- Welcome and support new members
- Be patient with language barriers and varying English proficiency
- Give and receive constructive feedback gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy toward other community members
- Credit others' work and ideas appropriately

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind

- Any conduct that creates a hostile, intimidating, or exclusionary environment for community members (including sustained patterns of behavior that may individually seem minor but collectively undermine community safety)

## Reporting

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **Contact an Admin directly** via direct message
   - Current Admins are announced monthly in #announce
   - Any Admin can help, or will connect you with the right person

2. **Use the @admins mention** in public channels (for urgent matters)
   - This notifies all Admins immediately
   - Use this for urgent safety concerns or ongoing harassment
   - Note: If you're in a private channel, please DM an Admin directly instead

3. **Email:** admin@macadmins.org (if you prefer not to use Slack)

### What to Include

When reporting, please provide:
