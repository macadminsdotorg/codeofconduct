# The Mac Admins Slack Vendor Guidelines<!-- omit from toc -->

Vendors can make up an important part of our community, and our Slack Workspace provides a unique method to engage with a user base directly, but vendors should adhere to the following guidelines to help ensure they do not engage in behaviour that violates our Code of Conduct.

## 1. Direct Messages

It is not permitted to direct message or use other communications tools to contact a member of our community for the purposes of promoting your product without their clear permission beforehand.

### 1.1 What is OK

Here's an example conversation that is OK.

> Vendor (in a public channel): Hey @personX, is it ok if I message you about #productY?

> personX: Sure, that's fine.

> Vendor (in a DM): Thanks for letting me contact you directly. I'd like to......

### 1.2 What is not OK

Sending direct messages or using outside communications tools to contact the user when they have responded in any manner that could be taken as a negative response to a posting in a public channel like the above.

## 2. Promoting Your Product in Public Channels

If you wish to promote your product in a public channel, it is important that:

- **2.a** Your message is relevant to the current discussion topic. For example, if you make a disk partitioning tool, it may be useful to post a link to your own channel if the current discussion is on that topic.
- **2.b** Your message cannot be considered 'spam' - in addition to being on topic, it shouldn't be posted repeatedly, either in the same channel or in multiple channels.
- **2.c** Your participation is timely and current, and not creating or adding to zombie threads that are more than 30 days without activity.

### 2.1 What is OK

Here's an example conversation that is OK.

> personX: I'm looking for a tool that performs X - does anyone have any ideas?

> Vendor: Hey @personX, I work for AwesomeTech and we make something that may help. Maybe you would like to come over to #awesome-tech?

### 2.2 What is not OK

> [Unrelated conversation]

> Vendor: So is it true that :  The new MacOS eliminates IMAGING… Deploy Studio???    [competitor] or OurProduct.com have possible the solutions?

## 3. The `#vendor-announce` Channel

We have created the `#vendor-announce` channel so that vendors, startups, and anyone wishing to promote a new project, product, or service (free or otherwise) that is relevant to members of the Mac Admins community may post without a requirement to be relevant to a current discussion, as is the case in all other public channels. A discussion may be pursued in the thread of the post.

You must still adhere to the remaining guidelines:

- **3.a** While this channel is meant for promotions, it can still be considered 'spam' if you post repeatedly or cross-post to other channels.
- **3.b** It is advised to create a new channel for your product, service, or tool, and invite people to join that channel if they wish to hear anything more about it.
- **3.c** Do not add direct links in the `#vendor-announce` channel to any competitions, giveaways, surveys, or other means of gathering personal information. Instead, direct people to your own channel or your own website.

## 4. Use of Private Channels

The Mac Admins Slack is not a substitute for a vendor operating their own platform. It is allowed to use private channels, but it is not allowed to require users to create accounts in Mac Admins Slack based on their company email in order to gain access to the channel. If you need to identify customers to interact with your customers, use your own enterprise system.
