### Vendor Conflicts

If two vendors from competing companies have a disagreement:

- Remember: you're representing your company

## Identity Verification for Vendors

Admins may request verification of vendor identity to ensure authenticity and prevent impersonation.

**When verification is requested:**
- Typically after a vendor becomes an active participant in discussions
- May be triggered by community reports or concerns
- Can be proactive for vendors in high-visibility roles

**Verification methods may include:**
- LinkedIn profile confirmation
- Company email verification
- Video call verification (for active participants)

**What happens if verification is refused:**
- Vendor may be subject to additional scrutiny
- Possible restrictions on promotional activities
- In cases of suspected impersonation, temporary suspension pending verification

Verification is not required for all vendors—only when authenticity concerns arise or for vendors with significant community presence.

## Enforcement

Vendor policy violations are handled according to the [Code of Conduct](./Code_of_Conduct.md) enforcement procedures:

### First Violation (Minor)
- Private warning from Admin
- Guidance on acceptable behavior
- Removal of offending content

### Second Violation or Moderate First Violation
