## [1. Purpose](#1-purpose)

These Community Guidelines supplement our [Code of Conduct](./Code_of_Conduct.md) with practical guidance for participating in The Mac Admins Slack. While the Code of Conduct defines what is not acceptable, these guidelines describe what good community participation looks like.

## [2. Getting Started](#2-getting-started)

### 2.1 Joining the Workspace

- Read and understand the [Code of Conduct](./Code_of_Conduct.md)
- Complete your profile with your name and role (optional but encouraged)
- Introduce yourself in #introductions
- Browse channel descriptions to find relevant discussions

### 2.2 Setting Up Your Profile

**Recommended profile information:**

- Full name (or preferred name)
- Current role and organization (optional)
- Pronouns (optional)
- Time zone (helpful for async communication)
- Profile photo (optional)

**Privacy note:** Only share what you're comfortable making public.

## [3. Communication Best Practices](#3-communication-best-practices)

### 3.1 General Guidelines

**Be Clear and Concise**
- Threading varies by channel - most channels don't thread as we predate that feature
- Observe channel norms before posting
- Break long messages into paragraphs
- Use formatting (bold, code blocks) appropriately
- Search before asking - your question may be answered already

**Be Respectful of Time**
- Use @admins only for urgent admin matters
- Respect "do not disturb" and timezone differences
- Be patient waiting for responses - this is an async community

**Be Inclusive**
- Remember this is a global community with varying English proficiency
- Avoid idioms and cultural references that may not translate
- Be patient with misunderstandings
- Offer clarification when asked

### 3.2 Technical Discussions

**Asking Questions**
- Search Slack history first
- Provide context (OS version, device model, MDM, etc.)
- Include error messages or logs (use snippets for long text)
- Post in the most relevant channel
- Share what you've already tried so we can help more effectively
- Update the thread if you solve your own problem

**Answering Questions**
- Be kind - everyone was new once
- Explain your reasoning, don't just post commands
- Link to documentation when relevant
- If you're unsure, say so
- Follow the channel's threading conventions

**Sharing Solutions**
- Share code snippets as files or formatted code blocks
- Sanitize private information
- Include comments in scripts
- Explain any prerequisites or caveats
- Link to GitHub repos for longer code
- Credit original authors if adapting their work

### 3.3 Debates and Disagreements

**Healthy Debate**
- Focus on ideas, not people
- Use "I" statements: "I've found..." not "You're wrong..."
- Acknowledge valid points
- Know when to agree to disagree
- Consider moving heated discussions to DM

**When Tensions Rise**
- Take a break before responding
- Assume good intent, but remember that impact matters regardless of intent—take responsibility if your words cause harm
- Ask clarifying questions
- Invite Admin mediation if needed
- Remember: being right isn't worth being rude

## [4. Channel Etiquette](#4-channel-etiquette)

### 4.1 Public Channels

**On-Topic Conversations**
- Read channel descriptions and topics
- Stay generally on-topic
- Ask Admins if you're unsure where to post
- Use #random for off-topic chat

**Cross-Posting**
- Avoid posting the same question in multiple channels
- If you must cross-post, mention where else you've posted
- Don't tag multiple people with the same question

**Reactions and Emoji**
- Use reactions instead of "+1" messages
- Common reactions:
  - ✅ = solved/resolved
  - 👀 = I'm looking into this
  - 🙏 = thank you
  - 📝 = documented/noted

**Special Channel Structures**

Some channels have specific posting and discussion patterns:

- **#appleseed** - Discussion of Apple Seed programs and beta testing
- **#apple-feedback** - Coordinating Apple feedback submissions
- **#jamf-product-issues** - Jamf-specific product issues and troubleshooting
- **#blog-feed / #blog-chat** - Blog posts appear in #blog-feed, discussion happens in #blog-chat
- **#jobs-board / #jobs-chat** - Job postings go in #jobs-board, discussion happens in #jobs-chat. Threaded replies on specific job postings are fine, but general chatter moves to #jobs-chat.
- **#politics** - There is a private politics channel. To request access, see the placeholder #politics channel and DM an Admin.

### 4.2 Direct Messages

**When to DM**
- Sensitive topics not appropriate for public channels
- Continuing a conversation that's gone off-topic
- Contacting Admins about [CoC violations](./Code_of_Conduct.md#6-reporting)
- Networking or mentorship requests (when you have an existing relationship or context from public channels)

**DM Etiquette**
- Ask if someone is open to DMs before sending lengthy messages
- Respect "no" - not everyone wants to chat privately
- Don't use DMs to bypass channel guidelines (e.g., unsolicited sales)
- Report inappropriate DMs to Admins
