## [1. Purpose](#1-purpose)

The Community Guidelines are a **supplement** to the [Code of Conduct](./Code_of_Conduct.md), and contain practical guidance to get the most out of your membership in the MacAdmins Slack.  Think of this document like a book of manners, or an etiquette guide for this networked space ("netiquette").

## [2. Getting Started](#2-getting-started)

### 2.1 Joining the Workspace(#21-joining-the-workspace)

- Read and understand the [Code of Conduct](./Code_of_Conduct.md).
- Complete your Slack profile; see [Section 2.2](#22-setting-up-your-profile) below.
- Browse and search the channel list to find relevant spaces for discussion.

### 2.2 Setting Up Your Profile(#22-setting-up-your-profile)

When you registered for the MacAdmins Slack, you used an email address to sign up.  If you need to change this email address later, you must contact an administrator for assistance.

Slack will ask you to enter information into your Slack profile. 

Required Field: [Full Name](#23a-about-the-full-name)

Optional Fields:
- [Display Name](#23b-about-the-display-name)
- Title
- Pronouns
- Name Pronunciation
- Phone Number

Other fields (available on Slack desktop app or via web browser)
- Github
- LinkedIn
- Blog
- Twitter
- Other Sites

### 2.3 Full Name vs. Display Name(#23-full-name-vs-display-name)

Slack allows users to decide whether they want to see messages displayed with a user's full name, or their display name.

**[Full Name](#23a-about-the-full-name)**

This field cannot be empty.  It is a global rule that applies to ALL Slack instances, not just the MacAdmins Slack.

**[Display Name](#23b-about-the-display-name)**

Treat this field like a username, shortname, handle, or alias.  

**Privacy Considerations**

If you do not wish to disclose your real name, you are free to put anything you want in the Full Name field.  

The MacAdmins Slack does not perform identity verification, and pseudonyms are allowed.  Having said that, we encourage you to use your real name to establish trust and facilitate networking with your peers.

If users decide to show display names instead of full names, they will see your display name if it is set.  Otherwise, they will always see whatever is in the "Full Name" field.

## [3. Communication Best Practices](#3-communication-best-practices)

**A Brief History of Slack**

Slack was created in 2012, and initially designed to mimic the experience of the old Internet Relay Chat system from the 1990s.  The acronym "S.L.A.C.K." stands for "Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge."  Search is arguably the single most powerful feature of Slack.  

**Lurking and Observing Slack Culture**

As Slack has evolved over time to add features that facilitate workplace collaboration, its has garned a devoted following of millions of users.  People have grown to use Slack in a variety of ways that were influenced by their life experiences, their exposure to the internet and especially IRC, or their workplace's culture and attitude toward Slack and office collaboration tools.

The MacAdmins Slack was created in mid-2015.  In long-running community spaces, certain behaviors and preferences established by the earliest members become an integral part of that community's heritage, and tend to dictate certain cultural norms.  You will find echoes of these cultural norms across the instance.

### 3.1 General Guidelines

As in any society, new members would be wise to "lurk" for a bit and observe how the community runs.  As a member, you are free to join as many or as few channels as you like.  You can scroll back to the beginning, or just catch up on what happened last week.

Here are some general norms to observe in the Slack instance:

**Be Considerate and Thoughtful**

- Always use the Search feature before posting; your question may already have been answered.
- Nesting replies into threads varies by channel; some insist on it; others do not care.
- Avoid posting short messages in rapid-fire succession; Slack is not a text messaging service.
- Use formatting as desired for **emphasis**, or to distinguishe `code` from text, or ~~strikeout~~ other text.
- If you make a mistake, you can edit your own messages up to 30 minutes after posting.
- Break long messages into shorter paragraphs as necessary.

**Be Respectful of Others' Time and Availability**

- A user's activity status and local time can be seen in their Slack profile; click or tap their username to check it.
- The MacAdmins Slack is an asynchronous community; replies may take several minutes, hours, days, or even weeks.
- Respect others' "do not disturb" settings and timezone differences.
- The Slack admins are volunteers with no SLA or guaranteed response time, but will do their best to respond as quickly as possible
- Only tag the @admins for truly urgent matters.

**Be Inclusive**

- English is the primary language on this Slack instance; however, this is a worldwide community with members whose native language is not English.
- Avoid idioms and cultural references that might not translate clearly.
- Offer clarification when asked.
- Ask for clarification if something is unclear.   
- In case of a misunderstanding, be patient.
- Assume positive intent.
- Consider accessibility when writing: your message may be read on a mobile phone, a tablet, a computer, or even a screen reader.


### 3.2 Technical Discussions

**Asking Questions**

- Use the Search feature in Slack before asking questions; yours might already be answered.
- Find and join a channel that is most relevant to your issue.
- Jump in and ask your question; there's no need to ask permission to ask a question.
- Provide sufficient context for the issue (e.g.: OS version, device type, MDM solution, etc.)
- Include relevant error messages and/or logs
- For longer log excerpts more than a few lines, please create a "text snippet" instead.
- Share what you've already tried so we can help more effectively
- The discussion might become threaded as replies or follow-up questions come in.
- Update the thread if you solve your own problem.

**Answering Questions**

- Be kind.  Remember: everyone was once a beginner.
- Explain your reasoning; avoid posting commands or solutions without context.
- Link to documentation when relevant.
- It's ok to say "I don't know."
- Follow the channel's threading conventions.

**Sharing Solutions**

- Share code snippets as files, formatted code blocks, or text snippets
- Sanitize, obfuscate, or make generic any information that could be private or sensitive (e.g.: passwords, access keys, file paths, usernames, etc.)
- Include comments in scripts.
- Explain any prerequisites, caveats, gotchas, etc.
- For large amounts of code, such as a project, we suggest creating a free Github repository and linking to that instead.
- If you borrow or adapt someone else's work, give them credit or attribution.

### 3.3 Debates and Disagreements

**Healthy Debate**

- Debate is an academic activity for finding solutions by critiquing ideas, not criticizing people.
- When necessary to point out a flaw, say something constructive ("I've found a problem," or "This seems to be incorrect") instead of accusing the person ("You're wrong because...")
- Acknowledge valid points within the debate.
- Know when to agree to disagree, and move on.
- If the discussion becomes heated in a channel, please use direct messages to work out the disagreement.

**When Tensions Rise**

- Take a break before responding.
- Assume positive intent, but remember that impact matters regardless of intent.
- Take responsibility if the other person tells you that your words caused harm.
- Ask clarifying questions.
- Invite an admin to mediate a discussion only as a last resort.
- Remember: being right isn't worth being rude.

## [4. Channel Etiquette](#4-channel-etiquette)

### 4.1 Public Channels

**Keeping Conversations On-Topic**

- Read channel descriptions and topics when joining.
- Stay generally on-topic.
- If you're unsure where to post or find discussion of an issue, ask in the #general channel.
- For truly off-topic chat, please use the #breakroom channel.
- Note: there may be private channels with special interests that require invitation by an existing member; the Slack admins cannot add you to them, and will not suggest any when asked.
- Warning: even in the off-topic and private channels, Rule 3.3 still applies.

**Cross-Posting**

- Avoid posting the same question in multiple channels.
- If you must cross-post, mention where else you've posted.
- Don't tag multiple people with the same question.

**Reactions and Emoji**

- To avoid cluttering channels with "me too" or "+1" messages, use Slack reactions ("reacji") to indicate your response or feeling about a message.
- Examples of common reactions:
  - 👍 = yes, agree, understood, thanks
  - ✅ = yes, accepted
  - 🚫 = no, rejected
  - 👀 = surprised, very interested, looking into this
  - 🙏 = high praise, thank you very much
  - 📝 = noted or documented

### [4.2 Special Channels](#42-special-channels)**

Some channels have specific posting and discussion patterns.  Please be careful to observe their rules and customs before posting.  NOTE: this list is not exhaustive.

- **#appleseed**: This channel is used to join the AppleSeed for IT private beta channel.  Read the rules and contact one of the coordinators to be invited to the private channel.
- **#apple-feedback**: This channel may be used to Coordinate Apple feedback submissions (formerly bug reports).
- **#jamf-product-issues**: This channel is for posting Jamf Product Issues opened by support, which might not appear in the "Known Issues" page on the Jamf Account portal.
- **#blog-feed**: this channel is powered by a Slack-integrated app called "RSS."  Blogs registered in this channel will post as soon as the author makes a submission.  The feed is self-managed by channel members, not by admins.
- **#blog-chat**: Discussion or support for #blog-feed belongs in this channel.
- **#jobs-board**: members in this channel are actively looking for work and will likely have notifications enabled for **all new messages**.  To minimize noise and distraction for job seekers, messages in the main channel must be limited to job postings only; any discussion or follow-up replies about a job posting MUST be a threaded reply to that message.
-  **#jobs-chat**: this channel is reserved for general discussion about the job market, a particular industry or employer, the general economy, or anything pertaining thereto.  Note: keep politically-oriented conversation to a minimum.
- **#politics** - There is a private politics channel. See [Section 8.2](#82-requires-caution).

*A note about #jobs-board: job postings may be posted by recruiters, hiring managers, employees, or even unaffiliated persons if they happen to find a great job listing and want to share it.  If the job is hiring in a jurisdiction or industry with a **legal** requirement to post the salary range (e.g.: CA, CO, NYC, parts of Europe, the public sector), then this information must be included in the job posting on Slack.  Failure to disclose required salary information **may** result in the message being removed.*

### [4.2 Direct Messages](#42-direct-messages)

**When to send Direct Messages**

- If you need to discuss sensitive topics not appropriate for public channels.
- Continuing a conversation that's gone too far off-topic.
- Privately resolving a conflict with a member.  Remember to be polite and professional.
- Contacting Admins about [Code of Conduct violations](./Code_of_Conduct.md#6-reporting)
- Networking or mentorship requests (when you have an existing relationship or context from public channels).

**Etiquette**

- Ask if someone is open to DMs before sending lengthy messages.
- Respect their "no"; not all members want to chat privately.
- If the DM suddenly makes you uncomfortable, stop replying and notify an admin.

## [5. Vendor and Commercial Participation](#5-vendor-and-commercial-participation)

See the detailed [Vendor Policy](./Vendor_Policy.md) for complete guidelines. 

Here are some general rules for vendors to follow:

**✅ Allowed:**

- You may participate authentically as a community member.
- You may answer technical questions about your products and services.
- You may share relevant announcements in appropriate channels (e.g.: software updates, new product launches)
- You must transparently disclose your affiliation with your vendor.

**❌ Not Allowed:**

- You may not post promotional content without context.
- You may not engage in astroturfing (generating fake grassroots support with multiple accounts).
- You may not create sockpuppet accounts (to post testimonials or promote products).
- You shall not send sales pitches, or recruit members via Direct Messages.
- You shall not impersonate someone else.
- You shall not directly recruit individuals without approval from the admins.
- You shall not complain about a Slack member to their employer via backchannels if they are a customer.
  You should not disparage your competitors; not only does it look unprofessional, but they're probably on this instance too, and your world as a vendor is smaller than you might realize.

## [6. Content Sharing](#6-content-sharing)

**OK to Share:**

- Blog posts (your own blog, or someone else's)
